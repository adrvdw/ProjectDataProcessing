                Before 2017, cryptocurrencies were relatively unknown among normal people. Almost no one had ever heard
                of cryptocurrecies. In 2017, Bitcoin showed a strong growth and set a

                above $20.000. All of a sudden, cryptocurrencies were all over the news, and all coins increased in
                value. This apparant eternal growth suddenly stopped, and all currencies began to depreciate, until this
                day. The problem is therefore that cryptocurrencies lack the usual fundamental metrics investors would
                look for when attempting to assign an appropriate value to an asset.

                can help to decide invest in cryptocurrencies and predict future expectations. This site shows
                therefore trends with time of all large cryptocurrencies.
